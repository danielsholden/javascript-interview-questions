#### Task: Write a function that implements the Promise.all, Promise.race, Promise.allSettled behaviour:

**Note:**
A function in the array can be either synchronous or asynchronous

**Example:**

```js
function promiseAll(array) {
   // code here
}

function promiseRace(array) {
   // code here
}

function promiseAllSettled(array) {
   // code here
}
```

#### Task: Calculating the sum of numeric values in an array

**Description:**
You need to write a function `sum(arr)` that calculates the sum of all numeric values in an array, including nested subarrays. In this case:

1. A “numeric value” refers to numbers, as well as strings that can contain numbers.
2. An array can be nested, contain any data types (numbers, strings, objects, etc.).
3. **Do not** use built-in methods to “flatten” an array, such as `.flat` or `.flatMap`.
4. Any array elements that do not meet the “number or string with leading digits” criterion are ignored.

**Example:**

```js
function sum(arr) {
   // code here
}

sum([null, 1, 'x', '2x', ['3', ['x2', '5']]]);
```

#### Task: Implement the `curry(fn)` function

**Description:**

You need to write a function `curry(fn)` that allows you to call `fn` in a partially applied form:

- Passing arguments can be done in batches (in multiple calls).

**Example:**

```js
function sum(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

const curriedSum = curry(sum);

curriedSum(1, 2, 3); // 6
curriedSum(1, 2)(3); // 6
curriedSum(1)(2)(3); // 6
```

#### Task: Implement the `concatString()` function

**Description:**

You need to write a `concatString()` function that can take multiple arguments, where:

1. **First argument** is a delimiter (string or character).
2. **The remaining arguments** are the values to be combined into a total string by inserting the specified delimiter between the elements.

**Example:**

```js
concatString('.', 'a', 'b', 'c'); // -> "a.b.c"
concatString('-', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'); // -> "a-b-c-d-e"
```

#### Task: Implement `fetchData` function with retry logic

**Note(!):**  I've seen the task a lot of times and it's a fairly popular task for technical interviews.

**Description:**  
We need to create a function named `fetchData(url)`, which performs an HTTP (or similar) request and returns the data when successful. In case of failure, the function should automatically retry up to 5 times. If after 5 attempts the request is still failing, it should throw an error with the message `"Failed to retrieve data"`.

**Constraints:**

1. Do **not** use `async/await`.
2. Maximum 5 attempts for the request.
3. On the 5th failed attempt, throw an error with the specified message.

```js

const fetchData = (url) => {
   // code here
};

fetchData('someurl.com');
```

#### Task: Promise Chaining

**Note(!):**  The most popular tasks in different variants

What the console will print and how the code will work and why:

```js
Promise.resolve(1)
  .then(x => x + 1)
  .then(x => { throw x })
  .then(x => console.log(x))
  .catch(error => console.log(error))
  .then(x => x)
  .then(x => Promise.resolve(x))
  .catch(error => error)
  .then(x => console.log(x));
```

#### Task: Check if a string is a pangram

**Description:**  
We need a function `isPanagram(str)` that determines whether a given string contains **all the letters** of the English alphabet (case-insensitive). If the string includes at least one occurrence of each letter (A to Z), it is considered a **pangram**.

A pangram is a sentence or phrase that contains every letter of a given alphabet at least once. For example, the classic English pangram is:
> "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

```js
function isPanagram(str) {
  // code here
}

isPanagram("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog") // true
isPanagram("abc") // false
```

---

#### Task: Timeout a request and throw an exception

**Description:**  
We need to create a function `makeRequest(fn, timer)` which executes some asynchronous request (represented by `fn`) and, if it does not complete within the specified `timer` milliseconds, throws an exception.

**Key Points:**

1. `fn` is presumably a function returning a promise or handling some async task.
2. `timer` is the maximum allowed duration (in milliseconds).
3. If `fn` completes (resolves/rejects) before `timer` expires, we proceed with that result.  
4. If the timer elapses first, we must throw an error or reject with a timeout message.

```js
function makeRequest(fn, timer) {
  // code here
}
```

#### Task: Enhance array's `groupBy` functionality

**Description:**  
We need to create (or extend) a method `groupBy` for arrays. This method groups items based on a specific function/key.

**Examples:**

```js
[1, 2, 3].groupBy(String)
// => { "1": 1, "2": 2, "3": 3 }

[1.1, 1.5, 3.3].groupBy(Math.round)
// => { 1: [1.1, 1.5], 3: [3.3] }

[{ id: 1 }, { id: 1 }, { id: 2 }].groupBy(fn)
/*
   where fn = (item) => item.id
*/
// => { 1: [ { id: 1 }, { id: 1 } ], 2: [ { id: 2 } ] }
```

#### Task: Sequentially execute an array functions
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-not_solved-red)

**Description:**  
We need a function `asyncQueue(arr)` that takes an array of functions. Each function may be:

- Synchronous, or
- Asynchronous (returning a promise, e.g. with a `setTimeout`).

We need to **execute them one after the other**—i.e., start the next function **only after** the previous one has finished (resolved). Can we solve the task without `async/await`?

**Code Example:**

```js
function asyncQueue(arr) {
  // ...
}

const array = [
  () => console.log('Task 1'),
  () => new Promise((resolve) => 
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Task 2');
      resolve();
    }, 500)
  ),
  () => console.log('Task 3'),
];

asyncQueue(array);
```

#### Task: Convert all object keys from `snake_case` to `camelCase`

**Description:**  
We have an object whose keys use `snake_case` (e.g., `first_name`, `last_name`). We need to transform **all** these keys into `camelCase` (where the first letter of each word is capitalized, except for the first letter, such as `firstName`).

**Key Points:**

1. Any existing keys in `snake_case` (like `some_key_example`) should become `someKeyExample`.
2. If the object is **nested**, the transformation applies **recursively** to all nested objects.
3. Arrays may appear as values; if there are objects within arrays, their keys also need transformation.
4. Only the keys change — the values remain the same.

We need a function such as:

```js
function convertKeysToPascalCase(obj) {
  // ...
}
```

---

#### Task: Convert array of numbers into ranges

**Description:**  
We have a function `getRanges(arr)` that receives an **unsorted** array of numbers. It needs to **identify all sequences** of integers, then present them as range strings. Each range covers a **start** and an **end** of a consecutive run. If the run is just a single number, start and end are the same.

**Example:**

```js
function getRanges(arr) {
  // code here
}

getRanges([11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14]); // '0-4', '7-9', '11-14'
getRanges([4,3,1,2]); // '1-4'
getRanges([7]); // '7-7'
```

#### Task: Implement a throttling function
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-not_solved-red)

**Description:**  
We need to write a function `throttle(fn, delay)` that limits how often `fn` can be called. Specifically, once `fn` is called, any subsequent calls within the `delay` period should be ignored (or queued until `delay` passes, depending on exact behavior) and only the next call after `delay` expires should be processed.


```js
function throttle(fn, delay) {
  // ...
}
```

#### Task: [Form smallest number from two digit arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/form-smallest-number-from-two-digit-arrays)

**Description:**  
You're given two arrays of digits, and the goal is to form the smallest possible integer by choosing exactly one digit from each of the two arrays, and then combining them. There can be additional rules or constraints on how you pick or order those digits, typically resulting in a two-digit (or possibly more detailed) integer. The question asks for the **resulting smallest integer** that meets the given criteria.

**Key Points**

1. **Two Input Arrays**  
   Each array contains single-digit integers (0 to 9). The problem might involve checking overlaps, or choosing matching digits under certain conditions.

2. **Forming the Smallest Integer**  
   You must pick exactly one digit from each array and combine them into an integer according to the problem statement. The primary focus is to minimize that integer.

3. **Output**  
   Return (or print) the resulting integer that is the smallest by the problem’s definition.

**Example 1:**
Input: nums1 = [4,1,3], nums2 = [5,7]
Output: `15`
Explanation: The number 15 contains the digit 1 from nums1 and the digit 5 from nums2. It can be proven that 15 is the smallest number we can have.

**Example 2:**
Input: nums1 = [3,5,2,6], nums2 = [3,1,7]
Output: `3`
Explanation: The number 3 contains the digit 3 which exists in both arrays.

```js
function minNumber(nums1, nums2) {
    // code here
};
```

#### Task: [Battleships in a Board](https://leetcode.com/problems/battleships-in-a-board/description/)
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-solved_with_hint-yellow)

**Description:**  
You are given a 2D board (grid) representing a **Battleship** field, where each cell is either `'X'` (part of a ship) or `'.'` (water). You need to **count** how many distinct battleships are present. According to the rules in this problem, ships can only be placed **vertically** or **horizontally** (no diagonal parts), and no two ships will be adjacent horizontally or vertically (meaning there's at least one `'.'` cell separating them, except for the continuous cells that form a single ship).

#### Key Points

1. **Input Grid**  
   - Characters: `'X'` for a segment of a ship, `'.'` for water.
   - Grid may be various dimensions: `m x n`.

2. **Battleship Definition**  
   - A battleship is a **sequence of contiguous 'X' cells** either along a row (horizontal ship) or along a column (vertical ship).
   - No diagonal adjacency is used to connect parts of a ship.
   - Ships are separated from each other by at least one cell of water (no `'X'` cells from different ships touch horizontally or vertically).

3. **Output**  
   - A single integer representing **the total number** of battleships found in the given grid.

4. **Constraints**  
   - Grid size could be up to a certain `m` and `n` (details in the problem statement).
   - The input guarantees no invalid ship placements (e.g., diagonal adjacency forming a single ship or adjacent ships without proper spacing).

**Example 1:**
![battlefield](/public/battlefield.png){ width=50% }
Input: board = `[["X",".",".","X"],[".",".",".","X"],[".",".",".","X"]]`
Output: `2`

**Example 2:**
Input: board = `[["."]]`
Output: `0`

```js
function countBattleships(board) {
    // code here
};
```

#### Task: [Design an ATM machine](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-an-atm-machine/description/)

(favorite task)


**Description:**  
You have to design a simplified ATM machine that manages banknotes of certain denominations. This ATM supports **depositing** a certain count of each type of banknote, and **withdrawing** a specified amount if possible, returning how many banknotes of each type are dispensed.

#### Key Points

1. **Banknote Types**  
   Typically, the problem states the machine handles fixed denominations (e.g., `[20, 50, 100, 200, 500]`).  
   - Each denomination has an internal count (i.e., how many notes of that type are currently in the machine).

2. **Operations**  
   - **Deposit**: You receive an array specifying how many notes of each denomination to deposit.  
   - **Withdraw**: You receive an integer amount to withdraw. You must determine if it is possible to dispense that amount using the notes available.  
     - If possible, return how many of each type are used (often from the largest denomination to the smallest, or vice versa).  
     - If not possible, return some indication (like `[-1]` or an empty array, depending on problem statement) because the machine either doesn't have enough notes or cannot match the exact amount with available denominations.

3. **Constraints / Mechanics**  
   - Denominations are used in a specific order. Usually you try to dispense from largest to smallest to minimize the number of notes (depending on the problem requirement).  
   - You cannot exceed the number of notes available for any denomination.  
   - If exact amount cannot be formed, the transaction is invalid.

4. **Output**  
   - For a **Withdraw** operation, either the array of counts for each banknote type (reflecting how many notes are dispensed) or an error indicator if not possible.  
   - For a **Deposit** operation, there might not be a special output besides updating internal state.

---

## Examples

1. **Deposit and then Withdraw**  
   - Deposit `[0,0,1,0,2]` meaning 1 note of 100 and 2 notes of 500 are added.  
   - Withdraw `600`: Use 1 note of 100 and 1 note of 500 if the logic is largest-first.  
     - Return something like `[0,0,1,0,1]` indicating how many of each type were dispensed.

2. **Not Enough Notes**  
   - If you try to withdraw `120`, but you only have one 100 note and zero 20 notes, it fails. Possibly return `[-1]`.

3. **Edge Cases**  
   - Attempting to deposit or withdraw `0` amounts.  
   - Large withdraw requests that exceed machine capacity.  
   - Various combinations to see if partial usage of denominations is needed.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
`["ATM", "deposit", "withdraw", "deposit", "withdraw", "withdraw"]`
`[[], [[0,0,1,2,1]], [600], [[0,1,0,1,1]], [600], [550]]`
**Output**
`[null, null, [0,0,1,0,1], null, [-1], [0,1,0,0,1]]`

**Explanation**
**`ATM atm = new ATM();`**
**`atm.deposit([0,0,1,2,1]);`**
`- Deposits 1 $100 banknote, 2 $200 banknotes, and 1 $500 banknote.`

**`atm.withdraw(600);`**
`- Returns [0,0,1,0,1]. The machine uses 1 $100 banknote and 1 $500 banknote. The banknotes left over in the machine are [0,0,0,2,0].`

**`**atm.deposit([0,1,0,1,1]);`**
`- Deposits 1 $50, $200, and $500 banknote. The banknotes in the machine are now [0,1,0,3,1].`

**`atm.withdraw(600);`**
`- Returns [-1]. The machine will try to use a $500 banknote and then be unable to complete the remaining $100, so the withdraw request will be rejected.  Since the request is rejected, the number of banknotes in the machine is not modified.`

**`atm.withdraw(550);`**
`- Returns [0,1,0,0,1]. The machine uses 1 $50 banknote and 1 $500 banknote.`

```js

var ATM = function() {
    
};

/** 
 * @param {number[]} banknotesCount
 * @return {void}
 */
ATM.prototype.deposit = function(banknotesCount) {
    
};

/** 
 * @param {number} amount
 * @return {number[]}
 */
ATM.prototype.withdraw = function(amount) {
    
};
```
