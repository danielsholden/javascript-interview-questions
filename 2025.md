#### Task: Render incoming messages in ascending order by `message.id`

**Description:**  
We receive messages (e.g. via `connect`) potentially in **wrong order** (their `message.id` can be out of sequence). We must **render** these messages **as soon as possible** in the correct ascending order of `message.id`. The challenge is to ensure that if `message.id` 2 arrives before `message.id` 1, we do not display them out of order. Yet, we should still display them "as soon as possible" — so if we already have a gap (e.g., we’re waiting for message 1), once message 1 arrives, we can render both 1 and 2 without further delay.

#### Key Points

1. **Message IDs**:  
   - They start from 1 and go upwards (2, 3, 4, ...).
   - They can arrive in **any** order, not necessarily sequential.

2. **Rendering Logic**:
   - We have a function `render(message)` that outputs the text corresponding to the message in the correct order.
   - We cannot render message with `id = 2` if `id = 1` hasn’t been rendered yet, etc.
   - Once we receive any missing message(s), we should immediately render **all** consecutive messages that are now available.

3. **As Soon As Possible**:
   - If message 3 arrives but we’re still missing message 2, we can’t render 3.
   - But once message 2 arrives, we can promptly render 2, then 3, and so on.


```js

   const render = (msg) => console.log(msg);


   const subscribe = (connect, render) => {
     // code here

     connect((msg) => {
       render(msg.message);
     });
   }

   
```

#### Task: Print a file/folder tree without recursion

**Description:**
We have a hierarchical data structure representing a folder tree, each node containing a `name` and, optionally, `children` (an array of sub-nodes). The goal is to **print** the entire tree structure in a console-friendly format **without using recursion**. This means you must rely on an iterative approach to traverse the tree.

**Expected output:**

```js
  src
    index.html
    webpack.config.js
    assets
      image_1.jpg
      image_2.jpg
      image_3.jpg
      image_4.jpg
    scripts
      my-script.js
      my-script.ts
    node_modules
      package_folder
        win32
          run.bin
        linux
          run.sh
```

**Example Tree:**

```js
   const example = {
     name: 'src',
     children: [
       { name: 'index.html' },
       { name: 'webpack.config.js' },
       {
         name: 'assets',
         children: [
           { name: 'image_1.jpg' },
           { name: 'image_2.jpg' },
           { name: 'image_3.jpg' },
           { name: 'image_4.jpg' },
         ]
       },
       {
         name: 'scripts',
         children: [
           { name: 'my-script.js' },
           { name: 'my-script.ts' },
         ]
       },
       {
         name: 'node_modules',
         children: [
           {
             name: 'package_folder',
             children: [
               {
                 name: 'win32',
                 children: [
                   { name: 'run.bin' }
                 ]
               },
               {
                 name: 'linux',
                 children: [
                   { name: 'run.sh' }
                 ]
               },
             ]
           },
         ]
       }
     ]
   }

  const renderTree = (tree) => {
    // code here
  }
```

#### Task: Reconstruct travel route from unordered tickets

**Description:**  
We have an array `tickets` where each ticket is an object containing exactly two properties: `from` and `to`. The tickets collectively form a single continuous route from a **start** location to an **end** location. However, the `tickets` array is **out of order**. The goal is to reorder or reconstruct the list of tickets so that each `from` matches the previous ticket’s `to`. Eventually, we obtain a path from the very first origin to the final destination.

**Example:**

```js
   const tickets = [
    { from: 'London', to: 'Moscow' },
    { from: 'NY', to: 'Bali' },
    { from: 'Moscow', to: 'NY' }
  ];

  // The output should be:

  [
    { from: 'London', to: 'Moscow' },
    { from: 'Moscow', to: 'NY' },
    { from: 'NY', to: 'Bali' }
  ];

  // This chain starts at London → Moscow → NY → Bali.

```

**Function Signature**:

```js
   const getDirection = (tickets) => {
     // code here
   }
```
